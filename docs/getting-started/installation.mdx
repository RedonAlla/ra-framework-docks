**RA Framework** is a component library that enables developers to build universal design systems. It is built on top of React Native, allowing you to develop apps for **Android**, **iOS**, and the **Web**.

**RA Framework** is supported in **[Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)** or React Native CLI initiated apps. Web support is made possible by **[react-native-web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)**.

First of all you need to download packages in your local storage. ex: `C:\ReactNative\framework`. And then you must install the packages with `npm` locally.

Follow **[this link](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally)** on how to install packages locally.


Installing packages using npm:
```bash
npm install C:/ReactNative/framework/<package_name>
```

## Plain react-native project

If you are using plain react-native project (without expo) you need to install `react-native-unimodules`.

And you needs to follow **[the additional installation directions here](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/?redirected)**.

Once that is finished, weâ€™ll have a plain react-native project which can use expo dependencies.

:::danger Take care

When running *npm add* on a local module, the whole `node_modules` folder of the local module gets pulled in. This means, before pulling in that local module, you might want to clear `node_modules` in the local module and run `npm install --production` so that your **devDependencies** (i.e. `react` and `react-native`) are not pulled in.

## Web (plain react web project)

If you are using plain react with `create-react-app` project (without expo) you need to install `react-native-web`.
