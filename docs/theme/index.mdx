# ðŸŽ¨ Theme

The theme object is where you define your application's color palette. By default there are two color palette light or dark from ra-theme-context.
You also can extend BaseTheme object to add custom/extra colors.

The **RA Theme Context** is part of the `RA Framework` and is available under the `ra-theme-context` NPM package.
